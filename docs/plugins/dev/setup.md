#Setup

This guide will walk you through getting your plugin working with Vaken's tooling.
Even though this guide is acting as if there is a plugin already created, it would be helpful to follow this BEFORE setting up
your plugin to ensure there aren't any errors during development.

1. [./codegen.json](./codegen.json) This file associates your plugin's type with the MongoDB object generated by the codegen. Add your plugin to this file as follows:
```
"generates": {
    "src/server/generated/graphql.ts": {
        "config": {
            "mappers": {
                "PluginName": "PluginNameDbObject",
}}}}
```
2. [./vaken.configv2.ts](./vaken.configv2.ts) Import your plugin to this file and export it as follows:
```typescript
import { Plugin1 } from './plugins/Plugin1/server';
import { Plugin2 } from './plugins/Plugin2/server';

export default [
	{
		package: [new (Plugin1), new (Plugin2)]
	},
];
```

3. [./src/client/plugins.ts](./src/client/plugins.ts) This file associates your plugin with the neccessary server files. Change it as follows:
```typescript
import { Plugin1 } from './plugins/Plugin1/server';
import { Plugin2 } from './plugins/Plugin2/server';

export const packages = [new Plugin1(), new Plugin2()];
```

4. [./src/server/plugins.ts](./src/server/plugins.ts) This file associates your plugin with the neccessary server files. Change it as follows:
```typescript
import { Plugin1 } from './plugins/Plugin1/server';
import { Plugin2 } from './plugins/Plugin2/server';

export const serverPlugins = [new Plugin1(), new Plugin2()];
```

After doing this, you're set to start developing your plugin for Vaken!
